    <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language used to create and structure web pages. <br> It provides the basic building blocks of a website +using elements like headings, &nbsp;&nbsp; paragraphs, links, and images. <br> HTML uses tags to define the content and its role on a webpage. <br> It works together with CSS for styling and JavaScript for interactivity.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Without HTML, web browsers would not know how to display content on the internet.</p>
